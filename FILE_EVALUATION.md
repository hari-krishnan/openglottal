# File-by-File Evaluation: Are All Files Needed?

Assessment of each file/directory in the OpenGlottal repo for open-source release.

---

## Essential — keep

| Path | Purpose |
|------|--------|
| **openglottal/** (package) | Core library: `__init__.py`, `cli.py`, `data.py`, `features.py`, `utils.py`, `models/*.py` |
| **scripts/*.py** | All scripts used: training (yolo, unet, unet_crop), eval (girafe, bagls), infer, analyze_gaw, make_montage, sweep_bagls_conf, generate_demo_videos, download_datasets |
| **paper/main.tex** | Paper source |
| **paper/refs.bib** | Bibliography |
| **paper/latexmkrc** | Build config for bibliography |
| **paper/fig1_pipeline.mmd** | Source for Figure 1 (export to Pipeline.png for PDF) |
| **paper/main.bbl** | Generated bibliography; **keep** so PDF builds with pdflatex-only if desired (or add to .gitignore and require bibtex) |
| **paper/*.png** (montage, Pipeline) | Figures; include if you want PDF to build out-of-the-box, or document “run make_montage / export Mermaid” |
| **configs/default.yaml** | Documented hyperparameters (not loaded by code; reference only) |
| **README.md**, **LICENSE**, **pyproject.toml**, **.gitignore** | Project metadata and docs |
| **OPEN_SOURCE_READINESS.md** | Release checklist |

---

## Redundant or optional — consider removing / not tracking

| Path | Recommendation |
|------|----------------|
| **paper/flowchart LR.mmd** | **Remove or merge.** Duplicate of fig1_pipeline.mmd (same five pipelines). The paper uses fig1_pipeline.mmd; this one is an older/alternate layout. Keeping one (fig1_pipeline.mmd) is enough. |
| **paper/main.aux, main.log, main.out, main.fls, main.fdb_latexmk, main.blg** | **Don’t commit.** LaTeX build artifacts; add to `.gitignore` so they’re regenerated on build. |
| **results/** (e.g. gaw_features.json, bagls_conf_sweep/*.json, bagls_eval.json) | **Don’t commit** (or put under a separate “artifacts” release). Generated by scripts; add `results/` to `.gitignore` unless you explicitly want to ship precomputed results. |
| **eval_results.json**, **eval_results_with_unet_only.json** (repo root) | **Don’t commit.** Generated by eval scripts; add to `.gitignore`. |

---

## Not used by code (documentation only)

| Path | Note |
|------|------|
| **configs/default.yaml** | No script loads it; README describes it as “all hyperparameters documented in one place.” Keep as reference; optional: add config loading in CLI later. |

---


## Summary

- **Remove:** `paper/flowchart LR.mmd` (keep `fig1_pipeline.mmd` only).
- **.gitignore:** LaTeX build artifacts, results/, eval_results*.json, and data/ are ignored. data/ and docs/ are not used by code.
- **Optional:** Commit `paper/main.bbl` so the PDF builds without running BibTeX; otherwise add `main.bbl` to .gitignore.

All other tracked files (package, scripts, paper source, config, tests, README, LICENSE, pyproject.toml) are needed for the current open-source release.
